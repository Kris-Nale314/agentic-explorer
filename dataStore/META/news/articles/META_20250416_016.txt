Meta Platforms is minimally impacted by US tariffs, with its core business in ad placements representing 98.8% of FY 2024 revenue. Two key risks are pressuring the stock: the ongoing FTC antitrust trial and the possibility of new EU levies on digital advertising revenue. I believe the chance of these risks being materialized is minimal. Certainly lower than what the market expects, as noted in the recent price action.
