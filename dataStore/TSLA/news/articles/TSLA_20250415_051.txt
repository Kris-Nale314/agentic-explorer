Enphase faces significant competition from Tesla's Powerwall, which threatens its market position. Enphase's reliance on non-US manufacturing sites and Chinese suppliers makes it vulnerable to potential tariffs, risking profitability given its substantial US revenue base. Tesla's energy segment has shown impressive growth, outpacing Enphase's declining revenue. Furthermore, Tesla's dominance in the EV market gives it a customer advantage.
