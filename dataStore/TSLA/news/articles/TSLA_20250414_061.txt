Cathie Wood has described Donald Trump's sweeping new tariff regime as “shock therapy” that could, paradoxically, clear the path to freer global trade. The founder and chief executive of ARK Invest, a high-profile US investment firm known for backing high-growth tech companies, argued that what looked like the “largest and most regressive tax increase in US history” may end up being a prelude to “serious negotiations” that reduce both tariffs and non-tariff barriers.
