    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Nasdaq Composite Spirals 4% Lower 3:11 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets have widened their losses after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell addressed tariffs and their impact on the economy. Chairman Powell warned that tariffs could throw a wrench into the central bank&#8217;s efforts to tame inflation and spur economic growth. The Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach to monetary policy in the meantime. The Nasdaq Composite is spiraling 4% lower, weighed down by a 9% drop in Nvidia (Nasdaq; NVDA) and other Big Tech names on the tariff fallout. All sectors of the economy are lower with the exception of energy, which is up 1% as a group. Here&#8217;s a look at where things stand as of late afternoon trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 847.60 (-2.10%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 713.07 (-4.24%) S&amp;P 500: Down 161.77 (-3%) Gainers in a Sea of Red 12:32 pm by Gerelyn Terzo While the markets are a sea of red, including a 2.1% drop in the Nasdaq Composite, there are some gainers if you dig deep enough. We found a few, including: eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY) is up 2.5% on the day and is inching closer to its 52-week high of approximately $71 per share. The online auction platform could be gaining from a newly announced partnership with Checkout.com for payments. Bitcoin stock MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) is tacking on 1.2% today while the bitcoin price continues to hover below the $85,000 level. On its best day, bitcoin serves as an inflationary hedge from the economy, which stands to benefit MSTR stock. Expand Energy (Nasdaq: EXE) is gaining 1.7% as a rising energy sector lifts those boats. Tariff Fallout 10:04 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets remain under pressure as of mid-morning trading, with the three major stock market averages stuck in a rut. While March retails sales rose a higher than expected 1.4%, the markets are obsessed with Nvidia (Nasdaq; NVDA), which warned that it will take a massive $5.5 billion charge for processor exports to China, giving the markets their &#8216;I told you so&#8217; moment. Magnificent Seven stocks are each down in the ballpark of 2% this morning, including Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), whose market cap has dipped below the $3 trillion threshold. The markets are under pressure out of the gate despite stronger than anticipated economic data. All three of the major stock market averages are trading in the red, including a 1.7% drop in the Nasdaq Composite, which is being weighed down by Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA). On the flip side, Applied Digital (Nasdaq: APLD) is gaining 5% today, bucking the otherwise downward trend, on the heels of its fiscal Q3 results. Despite missing Wall Street&#8217;s expectations, Applied Digital is benefiting from its roll in data center infrastructure for AI and high-performance computing, two white-hot tech trends. The gold price is rising 2.4% today to $3,319.30 per ounce as investors flock to the inflationary hedge during these times of heightened uncertainty. Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) is gaining 4% on the day as a beneficiary of the gold rush. The technology sector is being dragged lower by NVDA stock after the company revealed an upcoming $5.5 billion charge related to chip exports to China, igniting trade war selling once again. Nvidia shares are sinking 5.6% today. Most sectors of the economy are down, including a 2.4% decline for technology, while energy stocks are up by 1%. Each of the Magnificent 7 stocks is lower today. Retail sales grew by 1.4% in March, stronger than the expected 1.2% increase and providing yet another sign of a resilient U.S. consumer. Results excluding auto sales also beat economist projections, coming in at 0.5% vs. estimates of 0.3% even in the face of tariff uncertainty targeting the auto sector. Here\u2019s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 165.73 (-0.41%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 292.95 (-1.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 47.89 (-0.90%) Market Movers BofA analysts have reiterated their &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Nvidia stock, but it&#8217;s doing little to lift sentiment in shares today. The Wall Street firm also lowered their price target on NVDA to $160 from $200 per share, blaming tariff uncertainty. Oppenheimer analysts have begun coverage on new stock Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) with an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating attached. Piper Sandler likes Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) stock, reiterating its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on the EV maker while lowering the price target from $450 to $400 per share.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. U.S. to Isolate China 12:53 pm U.S. authorities are preparing to engage in talks with over 70 countries, urging them to block Chinese goods from passing through their territories, according to the WSJ. The U.S. aims to economically &#8220;cut off&#8221; China. This aligns with President Trump&#8217;s recent statement suggesting nations might need to choose between aligning with the U.S. or China. The approach seems to focus on fully isolating China, while China has pledged to stand firm. Technology Stocks Upgrades and Downgrades 11:00 am MSFT (Microsoft) Downgrade Details: BMO Capital reduced price target from $490 to $470, maintains Outperform rating. Reason: Slower growth in Azure&#8217;s legacy cloud business due to weaker economy, leading to reduced Azure growth estimates for next few quarters and FY26. Insight: Experts indicate slowdown in core legacy cloud businesses. BMO suggests lower capex intensity in FY26 could be a positive catalyst for shares. NVDA (Nvidia) Issue: U.S. Government now requires licenses to ship H20/equivalent AI chips to China and arms-embargoed countries. Nvidia announced $5.5B charge in fiscal Q1 for inventory, purchase commitments, and reserves. Impact: Charge suggests high likelihood of H20 restrictions and low chance of future licenses. Q1 GAAP EPS may take a 20% hit, but non-GAAP sales/EPS less affected. Analyst View: BofA calls restriction &#8220;unwelcome but somewhat expected,&#8221; deems risk &#8220;manageable.&#8221; Maintains Buy rating, but lowered price target from $200 to $160. MRVL (Marvell) Downgrade Details: BofA cut price target from $120 to $72, retains Buy rating. Context: Expects Q1 results to beat due to conservative outlooks and tariff-related demand pull-ins. However, tariffs pose risks: Modest tariffs: 4%-6% sales hit, 12%-13% EPS hit. Deeper tariffs: 9% and 12% sales decline in 2025 and 2026, respectively. Reason: Lowered targets across semis coverage due to growing tariff uncertainty. TSLA (Tesla) Downgrade Details: Piper Sandler reduced price target from $450 to $400, maintains Overweight rating. Reason: Q1 deliveries (337,000 units) missed consensus, likely pushing gross margins to multi-year lows. Lack of clarity on Model 2 specs/pricing hinders reliance on new products for growth. Outlook: Short-term bearish due to weak Q1 financials, but &#8220;big picture&#8221; catalysts could drive sharp rallies. Estimates cut to reflect challenging near-term outlook. The semiconductor sector\u2019s woes are hammering tech ETFs, with funds heavy in Nvidia and other chipmakers leading the market\u2019s slide. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), packed with names like Nvidia, AMD, and ASML, cratered over 3.75% after the U.S. tightened export controls on AI chips to China. Nvidia, the ETF\u2019s top holding, warned of a $5.5 billion charge as its H20 processors now require export licenses. The restrictions also hit AMD as the company export controls to apply to MI308 products, resulting in $800 million. Both stocks plunging close to 6% so far today. ASML, a key supplier of chip-making equipment, sank 5.75% after dismal order numbers and tariff warnings. Nasdaq Composite: -1.76% S&amp;P 500: -1.00% Dow Jones Industrial Average: -0.42% Today&#8217;s selling pressure raised the CBOE VIX index 3% after market fear dissipated the past two days.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Another market reversal 1:03 pm by Joel South U.S. stock markets advanced, with the S&amp;P 500 increasing by 1.4%, the Dow rising 484 points (1.2%), and the Nasdaq gaining 1.7%, even as trade disputes and weak consumer confidence fueled earlier fluctuations. This rebound follows China&#8217;s imposition of 125% tariffs on U.S. products, contributing to persistent uncertainty after a turbulent week sparked by U.S. tariff announcements. The stock market is shrugging off the latest salvo between the U.S. and China over trade. All stock indices opened slightly higher at the morning bell, with the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) up 0.7%. China raised its tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%, matching the rate President Trump had imposed on Chinese imports. Beijing, though, said it no longer matters what further increases the U.S. hits it with as it will not respond because &#8220;Given that, at the current tariff level, U.S. exports to China are no longer commercially viable, China will not respond to any further tariff hikes by the U.S. on Chinese goods.&#8221; With Trump having essentially eliminated the de minimis rule that Chinese marketplaces like Temu and Schein used to ship cheap goods to the U.S. duty-free, it&#8217;s not unreasonable to say trade between the U.S. and China is dead. Big names bolster market Although most components of the Vanguard ETF are down, the biggest components of the index are moving higher. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), representing the second largest position in the exchange-traded fund at over 6%, is up more than 2%, helping to drive the ETF higher. Even though top dog Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in the red, it is almost at break-even so its impact is negligible. Yet some components are up strongly in morning trading. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which is the eighth largest position, is up 3.4%. The AI chipmaker&#8217;s stock has held up better than most over the tumultuous week with shares 22% higher. Banking on trading turmoil What is buoying stocks this morning are the results of bank stock earnings starting to come in with giants like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) reported record revenue on higher trading despite caution over economic headwinds. JPM stock represents 1.5% of VOO&#8217;s portfolio, just behind 10th place Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) at 1.6%. JPMorgan is up 2% in morning trading. Other financial stocks in the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF that reported earnings today include Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), both of which had better than expected results. Yet banks were also being very cautious and were setting aside larger amounts for credit losses. It suggests they foresee tougher times coming and are preparing for the worst. JPMorgan&#8217;s provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter rose to $3.3 billion from $2.6 billion. Wells Fargo&#8217;s provision, however, was lower than expected. It set aside $932 million, less than the $1.2 billion Wall Street wass anticipating. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s credit loss provision was just $135 million, but it is markedly higher than the $6 million et aside in its year-ago first quarter.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Markets Lose Their Mojo 4:00 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets finished the day much like they started it &#8211; lower. All three of the major stock market indexes were sent reeling today, including an eye-popping 4% drop in the Nasdaq Composite. Right behind it was the Dow Jones Industrial Average, with nearly another 1,000-point drop, and the S&amp;P 500, falling 3.3%. President Trump is willing to extend the 90-day tariff relief, but it did little to lift the market sentiment today. Meanwhile, the trade war with China is only becoming more intense, with Fox Business reporting that President Trump is looking to delist China-listed companies from the U.S. stock market. Here&#8217;s a look at today&#8217;s damage: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 964.73 (-2.38%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 698.15 (-4.08%) S&amp;P 500: Down 181.50 (-3.3%) Tariff Fears Return 1:36 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The Nasdaq Composite&#8217;s 5.8% drop is being fueled by declines in Big Tech, including Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN), which are each down between 4% and 7% today. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 is barreling toward circuit breaker status in which trading on the NYSE is halted to prevent further panic selling. President Trump is speaking with Cabinet members today on Capitol Hill while a U.S./China trade war fuels selling. Every sector of the economy is showing red today, including a 6.7% drop in energy stocks. Apple Falls 6% 11:52 am by Gerelyn Terzo Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock is falling by over 6% in today&#8217;s trading action. The declines come on the heels of the day in which it experienced its best trading day in nearly three decades. The broader market selling has intensified, sending the Nasdaq Composite spiraling by about 5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower by 3.4% and the S&amp;P 500 lower by 4.2%, erasing much of yesterday&#8217;s gains. Tariffs are easing while inflation is falling, but stocks are still spooked. Roller Coaster Ride 10:06 am by Gerelyn Terzo Stocks remain under pressure as of mid-morning trading, including a 3.2% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite after yesterday&#8217;s historic performance. The easing tariffs have failed to lift market sentiment today. Used-car platform CarMax (NYSE: KMX) is falling 14% after a disappointing fiscal Q4 earnings print. Taiwan Semi (TSMC) is falling by 3%. Trump Media (Nasdaq: DJT) is falling 1%. U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) is falling by 7.3%. The markets opened in a sea of red on the heels of yesterday&#8217;s historic rally. Today these skittish markets are taking back some of those gains after investors followed President Trump&#8217;s advice to buy the dip. Despite tariff relief, all three of the major stock market averages went south, with Big Tech names dragging the Nasdaq Composite lower. Most sectors of the economy were under pressure in early trading, including declines of over 3% each in energy and tech. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) is down 3% this morning. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on CNBC that the current market environment could be a tailwind for acquisitions. He also believes sellers on the e-commerce platform would pass along tariff costs to consumers. The company continues to invest heavily in AI. The markets has the opportunity to shift their attention from tariffs to inflation this morning. In a dose of good news, the Labor Department&#8217;s latest inflation print came in cooler than expected, with consumer prices easing to 2.4% in the 12-month stretch leading up to March, compared with economists expectations of 2.6%. On a monthly basis, the CPI declined by 0.1% last month after climbing higher by 0.2% in February, a welcome shift. Historically, March inflation generally increases, with this year marking a notable shift in the trend. Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 706.27 (-1.74%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 478.08 (-2.7%) S&amp;P 500: Down 117.81 (-2.16%) Market Movers Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) stock is off 5% today. The company has begun selling its EVs in Saudi Arabia where it is hoping to drive a social shift in the oil-rich Kingdom that is dependent on fossil-fueled powered vehicles. Cognizant Technology Solutions (Nasdaq: CTSH) is falling by 3% today after inking a partnership deal with OMRON&#8217;s automation business products. With a market cap of $34.8 billion, CTSH pays a dividend yield of 1.8%. Energy stocks are also under pressure, including Constellation Energy (Nasdaq: CEG), which is falling by 3.5% today. The stock is up over 10% in the past five days and is experiencing profit taking today though it remains above the $200 threshold.
