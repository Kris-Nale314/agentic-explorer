Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD)Â CEO Jensen Huang flew into Beijing on Thursday, days after the US tightened export rules on its H20 AI chips, cutting off a key product line to China. The company warned it could lose $5.5 billion in sales this quarter due to the new restrictions, which limit exports of high-bandwidth GPUs.
