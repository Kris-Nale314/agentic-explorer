The Magnificent Seven stocks have stumbled in 2025, while defensive niches like gold miners have surged, with gold miners up 55% YTD. I am upgrading the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF to a buy, seeing NVDA as washed out and undervalued below $90. May has been NVDA's best month on the calendar, and earnings are on tap.
