General Motors is partnering with Nvidia to integrate AI across its business, enhancing manufacturing, logistics, and autonomous driving while avoiding high R&D costs. Nvidia's AI platforms, including Omniverse and DRIVE AGX, enable GM to optimize factory processes, improve vehicle tech, and streamline logistics with advanced simulations and robotics. GM's pragmatic approach contrasts with Tesla's capital-intensive in-house AI development, balancing innovation with risk management and leveraging Nvidia's proven AI expertise.
