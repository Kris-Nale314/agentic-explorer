    "image": "https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/why-do-chase-shopping-offers-feel-blah-compared-to-20250416.jpg",

    "text": "In the world of cash-back credit cards, Chase and Capital One are undoubtedly two of the best places to start. With various credit cards offering a myriad of benefits and perks, there is every reason to consider either of these card issuers when looking for something great. Key Points Shopping websites are available to both Capital One and Chase credit card holders. The Capital One site is arguably much easier to use and has more partners available. The Chase website does offer seasonal offers and strong notification alerts. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) One Redditor explains why these two brands are so favored by pointing out that Chase and Capital One have specialized shopping websites. Both of these websites offer cardholders discounts at various retailers and the opportunity to earn even more cashback. The Concern What initially concerns this Redditor is that the variety of offers was just jarring when they logged into their Chase and Capital One shopping portals. The original poster immediately noticed that Capital One had over 100 offers while their Chase account only had 14, which was a surprising difference. To be fair, this individual is new to Chase, which is likely why they are seeing so few offers, but it\u2019s concerning that this isn\u2019t immediately clear to this individual as a new Chase customer. A few comments in the Reddit post immediately highlight that once you have been a Chase customer for a while, the company learns your shopping habits and will show you more offers. There is a bit of a caveat here, as the Redditor admits they were able to find more offers and discounts eventually, but they wrote the post after they only saw the initial small selection of cashback offers. As a longtime Chase cardholder, I can verify that I could log in myself and see a similar number of offers compared to Capital One, but with the same caveat that they are not easy to find. The Offers Capital One If you are not familiar with either of these portals, as the Redditor is pointing out, both Chase and Capital One offer shopping portals that anyone with a card can join. In fact, with Capital One, the shopping portal is public, but having an existing card login helps you get directly into the portal setup. Once you are logged in, it\u2019s immediate that Capital One is focusing on getting your attention upfront with big names like up to 5% back at Walmart, 2% at Apple, 7% at Macy\u2019s, 13% at Best Buy, and so on. The thing with Capital One and what makes it such an attractive shopping portal is that the big names continue with Target, Dick\u2019s, Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s, and dozens more of your favorite retailers. Chase Unlike Capital One, which is open to the public, the Chase shopping portal requires you to log in with a Chase account. Once you are in, you have a vastly different setup that makes it a lot harder to identify where your offers are. I\u2019m very familiar with the Chase site, and finding a complete list of offers still takes several clicks. There is no question that Capital One is more user-friendly. This said, Chase offers also seem to lack the same level of big names, or at least from what is immediately apparent. You\u2019ll still see Dell, Office Depot, Lenovo, BackCountry, and other names like Samsung, but the &#8220;star power&#8221; isn&#8217;t there as far as retailers. Still, it takes a lot more searching on the website to find these offers, which ties directly back to the original poster\u2019s concern that Chase seems lacking. Which Is Better? In some ways, Chase has a leg up by highlighting offers for Spring Deals, which is a nice addition to its portal page. They also allow me to choose a set of favorite shopping categories like tech, home, beauty, etc. However, I still have to agree with the original poster and highlight that Capital One\u2019s layout is far easier to navigate, but it\u2019s also easier to pick which offers are online and which are in-store, a distinction I couldn\u2019t find on the Chase site. This distinction makes a big difference because I saw Petco offering me up to 7% cash back with my Capital One card. I purchased dog food there, so a benefit just appeared right before me that I immediately wanted to take advantage of it. Chase is upfront about special deals, seasonal sales, and bonus offers, but everything is more difficult to navigate, making it a more frustrating shopping experience. Even if Chase were to offer a slightly higher percentage than Capital One, trying to find it might be enough of a headache that I would choose Capital One and skip the headache.

    "text": "A day following &#8220;Liberation Day,&#8221; the talk of the town is that investors have been liberated from capital gains taxes. The Dow Jones is down 3.72%, the Nasdaq is down more than 5%, and the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSE: VOO) is down 3.93% as of 10:25 a.m. ET. Why is the market selling off? Tariffs announced by the Trump Administration are estimated to reduce trade by $900 billion this year. Almost every Wall Street bank is now pulling back economic growth estimates for the year. Tariff rates on other countries announced last night range from 10% to more than 50%. As of 2022, the United States had a weighted-average tariff rate of about 1.5%. However, after Trump&#8217;s tariff announcement yesterday the United States would have a weighted average tariff rate of 29%. Another issue driving stocks down today is the fact these tariffs appear to be less of a &#8216;negotiating tactic&#8217; and something that will be in place for a prolonged period of time. For example, both Vietnam and Israel announced large cuts to tariffs on U.S. goods, but saw reciprocal tariff rates of 46% and 17%, respectively. What Stocks Are Falling in the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF? What stocks in the VOO are seeing the biggest declines today? Retailers and Clothing: Williams-Sonoma is down 18.1%, Deckers Outdoor down 16.9%, Ralph Lauren down 16.9%, and Nike down 13%. Each of these companies faces not only reduced consumer spending if a recession happens but also have overseas supply chains that would see significant tariff impacts if these tariffs take effect as presented on April 9th. Consumer Electronics: Dell is down 15.3%, HP is down 15.7%, and Best Buy is down 15.8%. Once again, these companies not only face reduced consumer demand but significant tariffs on their products. Apple was down 9% in early trading but has trimmed its losses to 7.9%. The post Live: Vanguard S&#038;P 500 ETF (VOO) Plummets 4% as Nike (NKE) and Dell (DELL) Sink appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence group MLCommons unveiled two new benchmarks that it said can help determine how quickly top-of-the-line hardware and software can run AI applications. Since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT over two years ago, chip companies have begun to shift their focus to making hardware that can efficiently run the code that allows millions of people to use AI tools. As the underlying models must respond to many more queries to power AI applications such as chatbots and search engines, MLCommons developed two new versions of its MLPerf benchmarks to gauge speed. aAdsList.push('Article'); aAdsListSize.push([300, 250]); aAdsListCA.push(null); One of the new benchmarks is based on Meta's so-called Llama 3.1 405-billion-parameter AI model, and the test targets general question answering, math and code generation. The new format tests a system's ability to process large queries and synthesize data from multiple sources. Nvidia submitted several of its chips for the benchmark, and so did system builders such as Dell Technologies. There were no Advanced Micro Devices submissions for the large 405-billion-parameter benchmark, according to data provided by MLCommons. For the new test, Nvidia's latest generation of artificial intelligence servers - called Grace Blackwell, which have 72 Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) inside - was 2.8 to 3.4 times faster than the previous generation, even when only using eight GPUs in the newer server to create a direct comparison to the older model, the company said at a briefing on Tuesday. Nvidia has been working to speed up the connections of chips inside its servers, which is important in AI work where a chatbot runs on multiple chips at once. The second benchmark is also based on an open-source AI model built by Meta and the test aims to more closely simulate the performance expectations set by consumer AI applications such as ChatGPT. The goal is to tighten the response time for the benchmark and make it close to an instant response. (Reporting by Max A. Cherney and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) By Max A. Cherney and Stephen Nellis",
