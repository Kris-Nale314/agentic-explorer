Dell Technologies has strong growth tailwinds due to new products and untapped enterprise market in AI servers. There is also a PC refresh cycle coming into play later this year. Dell has a strong and growing market share position in servers and storage markets. A revenue mix shift toward these segments offsets its market share struggles in the PC business. The revenue mix shift paves the way for overall EBIT margin expansion going ahead.
