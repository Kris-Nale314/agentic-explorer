Dell Technologies stock has dipped ~20% in the past 5 days, creating a massive buying opportunity due to its strong AI server business and financial performance. Dell's AI server backlog surged to ~$9 billion, with revenue rising 7% YoY and net income up 27% YoY. Despite concerns about AI server margins, Dell's absolute profit from AI servers is significantly higher than traditional servers.
