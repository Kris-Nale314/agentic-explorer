I maintain my "Strong Buy" rating on Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL) due to its attractive valuation and promising growth prospects in AI and PC markets. Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) has shown significant growth, particularly in storage revenue, contributing to higher margins and profitability. The demand for AI infrastructure and data center modernization is expected to drive Dell's revenue, with AI server shipments projected to reach ~$15 billion by FY2026.
