With electric car maker Tesla (TSLA -5.06%) going from growing its vehicle deliveries at rates of around 50% annually as recently as 2022, to about flat sales growth in 2024 and declining sales to start the year in 2025, many investors are likely still trying to figure out how to value the automaker.
