BYD Company Limited saw a significant rebound in deliveries in March, with 377,420 new energy vehicles sold, marking a 24.8% year-over-year growth. The company projects Q1 '25 earnings of 8.5-10.0B Chinese Yuan, expecting profits to surge between 86% and 119% year-over-year. While BYD's deliveries in Q1 surged, Tesla's dropped, positioning BYD as the leading, large-cap EV growth play for investors.
