Meta's core business remains robust, with $52 billion in free cash flow and strong ad pricing power, despite a 30% stock drop. The market undervalues Meta at 20x trailing earnings, ignoring growth in WhatsApp, Threads, and AI, focusing instead on Reality Labs losses. Meta's management is committed to Reality Labs while scaling AI infrastructure, with significant capital returns through buybacks and a new dividend.
