    "boundary_detection": """
    Document boundary detection is crucial in AI systems working with mixed content. 
    
    Traditional approaches often chunk documents based solely on token count, which can split content mid-sentence or mid-concept. This creates context fragmentation that leads to:
    - Loss of critical relationships between concepts
    - Increased hallucination when information spans chunk boundaries
    - Reduced performance in retrieval and analysis
    
    Our boundary detection agent looks for semantic shifts indicating natural document boundaries:
    - Style and formatting changes
    - Topic transitions
    - Temporal discontinuities (e.g., date references that jump backward or forward)
    - Entity switches (different companies suddenly being discussed)
    - Discourse markers signaling conclusion or introduction
    
    By respecting these natural boundaries, we create chunks that preserve semantic coherence and improve downstream processing.
    """,
    
    "multi_agent_systems": """
    Multi-agent AI systems represent a significant advancement over single-model approaches.
    
    Rather than relying on one large model to handle all aspects of a task, multi-agent systems:
    - Leverage specialized expertise through dedicated agents
    - Enable complex workflows through agent collaboration
    - Improve transparency by making each step explicit
    - Enhance accuracy through cross-validation between agents
    
    Our system demonstrates how different agents, each with specific roles, collaborate to process mixed financial documents - mimicking how human teams with different specialties would approach the same problem.
    
    This approach is particularly valuable for complex tasks requiring different types of analysis on the same content.

# System prompts for OpenAI
SYSTEM_PROMPTS = {
    "boundary_detector": """
    You are an expert document analyst specialized in identifying boundaries between different documents that have been combined into a single text.
    
    Your task is to carefully analyze the provided text and determine where one document ends and another begins.
    
    Look for these signals:
    - Abrupt topic changes
    - Shifts in writing style or formatting
    - Changes in document type (e.g., from transcript to news article)
    - Temporal discontinuities (dates/times that don't follow in sequence)
    - Entity switches (different companies being discussed)
    - Discourse markers indicating endings or beginnings
    
    For each boundary you detect, provide:
    1. The approximate character position
    2. A few words before and after the boundary
    3. Your confidence level (high, medium, low)
    4. Your reasoning, including which signals led to your detection
    
    Be thorough in your analysis and explain your thinking clearly.
