I am proud of the team's execution this year. We navigated an incredibly dynamic AI environment and accelerating server consolidation, a significant pivot to Dell IP storage and a lagging PC refresh and delivered results above our long-term value-creation framework. We grew our company while reducing our operating expenditures over the course of the year. Our modernization have made us more efficient and provided us the ability to invest more innovation and in areas of strategic differentiation. Our FY '25 revenue was $95.6 billion, up 8%, with operating income of $8.5 billion. OpEx was reduced by 4% over the course of the year. This resulted in record EPS of $8.14, up 10%, and cash flow of $4.5 billion. We continue to differentiate ourselves with consistent performance through numerous economic cycles, different technology buying and adoption cycles and our rapidly innovating technology ecosystem.
