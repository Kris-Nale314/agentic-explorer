## Why Boundary-Aware Processing Matters for RAG

This document demonstrates several key advantages of boundary-aware processing:

1. **Context Preservation**: Natural document boundaries prevent context from being fragmented

2. **Entity Coherence**: Entities are tracked accurately across document sections

3. **Temporal Consistency**: Time-based information maintains proper ordering

4. **Complete Coverage**: Even long documents can be fully processed without arbitrary truncation


Agentic RAG with boundary awareness addresses the core limitations of traditional RAG systems.
