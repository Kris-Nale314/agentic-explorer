## Retrieval Method Comparison

### Retrieval with fixed_size chunking

Fastest method: **context**
Most unique results: **vector**

#### Retrieval Speed

- vector: 0.390s
- entity: 1.741s
- context: 0.025s
- hybrid: 0.064s

### Retrieval with boundary_aware chunking

Fastest method: **context**
Most unique results: **vector**

#### Retrieval Speed

- vector: 0.420s
- entity: 1.389s
- context: 0.005s
- hybrid: 0.015s

## Synthesis Method Comparison

### Factual Completeness Ranking

- MULTI_AGENT RESPONSE
- ENTITY_FOCUSED RESPONSE
- SINGLE_PROMPT RESPONSE

### Overall Best Method: **ENTITY_FOCUSED RESPONSE**

Reasoning: The ENTITY_FOCUSED RESPONSE effectively compares Dell Technologies Inc and Jeff Clarke, directly addressing the query. It also has a clear and well-organized structure, making it the most effective response overall.

## Educational Insights

### Single Prompt

Traditional RAG with a single prompt combining query and contexts

**Strengths:**

- Simplicity and efficiency
- Works well for straightforward queries
- Lower latency and token usage

**Limitations:**

- May miss nuance when handling complex information
- Often less structured than multi-agent approaches
- More prone to hallucination when contexts conflict

### Entity Focused

Organizes information by entities mentioned in the query and context

**Strengths:**

- Clearer structure for entity-heavy queries
- Better at disambiguating different entities
- Reduces confusion when multiple subjects are discussed

**Limitations:**

- Less effective for queries without clear entities
- May over-compartmentalize related information
- Higher latency than single-prompt approach

### Multi Agent

Uses specialized agents (researcher, synthesizer, critic) to collaborate

**Strengths:**

- More thorough fact-checking and evaluation
- Better handling of inconsistencies in context
- Higher overall quality through specialized roles
- Self-critique improves accuracy

**Limitations:**

- Significantly higher latency and token usage
- More complex implementation
- Diminishing returns for simple queries

### Summary


        Different RAG synthesis methods have distinct trade-offs in quality, structure, and efficiency.
        
        Traditional single-prompt RAG is simple and efficient but may miss nuance in complex scenarios.
        Entity-focused approaches provide better structure when multiple subjects are involved.
        Multi-agent systems deliver higher quality through specialization but with increased latency.
        
        The best synthesis method depends on query complexity, time constraints, and information structure.
